# windows-chocolatey

This repo helps install the [chocolatey](https://docs.chocolatey.org/en-us/) software management solution on Windows and installs some applications I like to have on all my Windows machines.


# Choco install

Open a Power Shell terminal as an administrator, and run: * [install.ps1](install.ps1)

> While this is a ps1 script, I generally just copy it line by line to avoid changing execution policy
